# eportfolio-bash

This repo contains my presentation about Bash and the corresponding tutorial exercises.

A possible solution to the exercises can be found in the `solution`-branch.

A [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is requied to complete the exercises.

For Windows 10 users that lack a Bash I reccomend [installing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux), which brings a Bash.
